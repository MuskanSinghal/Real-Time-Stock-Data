Real-time Stock Price Chart

Built a Single page client-side app (SPA) using HTML and Javascript:

1) It is a simple form to add stocks to the list and displays the list of added stocks.
2) It displays stock price in real time using chart.js
3) It uses a real-time stock reporting API. Link to the website: https://www.tiingo.com/
4) It update prices every 5 seconds in the chart. As we know that stock market operates only at certain times of the day and is closed on holidays, API calls are made efficiently and the real-time update is clearly visible in the graph.
5) Code is deployed on jsFiddle. Here is the link: https://jsfiddle.net/muskansinghal95/b07fnw1j/7/
